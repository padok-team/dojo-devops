# Dojo objectives

TL;DR: Learn how to deploy a web application on Kubernetes in AWS

Covered topics:
  - Infrastructure As Code
  - Infrastructure Deployment
  - Kubernetes
  - Build and deploy an web application in Kubernetes
  - Continous Integration & Continuous Delivery
  - High Availability of a web application in Kubernetes
  - Scaling of a web application in Kubernetes

This dojo is organised in several parts to cover all these subjects.

Since each of the topic could be a good choice for an entire Dojo, we will not deep dive. We will focus on basics and real working example. It's always satisfaying to achieve things even if there is some "magics" part that we don't undestand (for now !).

If you have any question, any issue and you want to know more about something, don't hesitate to ask a question !

For each exercice, there is a solution provided. First, try to do the exercice and find the solution by yourself. You can also ask to a member of Padok (and of course you can ask Google too). Don't get stuck on something and use the solution wisely.
